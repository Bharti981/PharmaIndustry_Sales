The dataset includes various factors affecting sales, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and store locality. A complete list of fields includes sales, store characteristics, holiday indicators, promotions, and competitor data.
# Project Goals

Analyze customer purchasing behavior. 
Predict daily sales up to six weeks ahead. 
Use machine learning and deep learning approaches for forecasting. 
Deploy a web-based tool to serve predictions to finance analysts.
